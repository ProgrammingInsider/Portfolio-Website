            Hi, I'm Amanuel Abera! <br/><br/> I'm a self-taught Full-stack Developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering and a fervent passion for creating dynamic, user-friendly web applications. My coding journey began at the age of 16, during my 11th grade, well before I embarked on my Mechanical Engineering degree. This early curiosity in technology evolved into a deep fascination with problem-solving, leading me to dive into web development with enthusiasm.
